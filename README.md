# Overview

As a developer in training, I'm interested in mastering the fundamentals of different languages, 
and this project was an opportunity to strengthen my knowledge of C#. In this software, I created 
a basic desktop application using Windows Forms, which allows the user to enter the information of the employee, save or delete them, 
and then retrieve that list even after closing the application.

The main purpose of this software was to learn how to manage data persistence in desktop applications 
using csv files, in addition to reinforcing concepts such as events, visual controls, list management, 
and writing/reading files in C#.
